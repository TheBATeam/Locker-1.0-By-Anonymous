Finally, I’ve found the original batch application (or Batch program maybe a better term). Which inspired me to write my own **batch code**. And, it became an inspiration for me to start batch programming and it was the first milestone in the path of learning batch programming.

The **ver. 3.0** also contains **ver.2.0** of the locker application, As some of our users were still habitual of using **ver.2.0** than new ver.3.0 (as it has totally new interface and working).

If you want to see **hidden ver. 2.0** in **ver 3.0**. Click on the **‘menu’** button and a window will pop-up that window contains the **‘Cmd version’** button.
